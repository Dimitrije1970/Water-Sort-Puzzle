**Water-Sort-Puzzle**

The Water Sorting Puzzle game is written in Python and can be played through the console. Players are presented with a set of containers, each filled with water of various colors. The objective is to sort the water into the containers so that each container holds only one color of water, using a limited number of steps.

To help players solve the game, the game includes a **decision tree** of every possible solution, given a certain number of steps. Players can use this as a hint to improve their gameplay or to gain a deeper understanding of the game's mechanics.

In addition, the repository features its own implementation of stack and queue data structures.
